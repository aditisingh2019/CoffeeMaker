<h2>2. Control Over Your Personal Information</h2>

<h3>2.1. Managing Your Data.</h3>
<p> If you live in certain states such as California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia, you have the right to request certain actions with respect to your data. We will endeavor to honor your requests if you live in another state as well, where possible and consistent with law.</p>
<p>You may submit a request to get a copy of your Personal Information, to understand what we collect and how we share your Personal Information, or to delete your Personal Information. We will need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may require us to request additional personal information from you or require you to log into your account.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, we may decline such a request, such as when we are unable to verify your identity, or when we are unable to delete your information for legal or regulatory reasons. If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for declining to comply with the request. You may submit a request by emailing us at coffeemakerprivacy@gmail.com with the subject line “Privacy Request.”
You may also correct or update your personal information, such as your name, username, and password, on your account profile page.</p>
<p>If you choose to use any of these methods to manage your data, we will not penalize you, charge you different prices, or provide different quality of services, except to the extent you limit our ability to process personal information needed to provide our Services. For example, if you have your data deleted, we may no longer be able to provide you with our products and Services or engage with you in the same manner.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about your request, you may email us at coffeemakerprivacy@gmail.com. Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia residents may appeal the denial of a request made by emailing coffeemakerprivacy@gmail.com, and we will respond within the legally required time period, including a written explanation of the results of your appeal.</p>

<h3>2.2. Requests From Others on Your Behalf.</h3>
<p>In certain circumstances, you may permit someone else (an “authorized agent”) to submit requests about your information on your behalf. The authorized agent must provide sufficient evidence to show that the authorized agent has the authority to act on your behalf, including, without limitation, proof that the authorized agent has been lawfully vested with power of attorney. We may deny a request in the event we are not able to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.</p>
<p>Please note that for privacy and security reasons, we may direct communications in response to an authorized agent’s request to you rather than to the authorized agent. For example, we may need to verify your identity and confirm directly with you that you have provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request, and it may take additional time to fulfill requests from authorized agents.</p>

<h2>3. How We Store and Protect Your Information</h2>

<h3>3.1. Data Storage and Transfer.</h3>
<p>If you create an Account on the Platform as a visitor from outside the United States, by using and/or accessing the Platform or Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of your information to and in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>3.2. Keeping Your Information Safe.</h3>
<p>We care about the security of your information and employ physical, administrative, and technological safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through our Platform and Services. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems. Please recognize that protecting your personal information is also your responsibility. Accordingly, we strongly recommend that you change your passwords often and not reuse passwords, use a combination of letters and numbers, make sure you use a secure browser, and otherwise take precautions when communicating your personal information on the internet.

<p>Our websites and online Services are not directed to, and we do not intend to, or knowingly, collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 16, nor do we knowingly sell or share personal information of children under the age of 16. In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will endeavor to delete that information. If you have knowledge that we have collected personal information from a child under 16, please contact us at coffeemakerprivacy@gmail.com.</p>
